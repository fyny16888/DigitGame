__Scalable, Transactional and Reliable Game Server Framework based on Pomelo and MemDB__

### Performance and Scalable
* Fast in-memory data access.
* Distributed architecture, system capacity is horizontally scalable. Performance can be linearly increased by simply add more servers.

### Distributed ACID Transaction
* [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)(Stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transaction support on distributed environment.
* Data atomicity and consistency guarantee, never leave dirty data in memory.
* Concurrency and locking control, which make it very easy to write concurrency code. High performance on concurrent system.

### High Availability
* Each server is backed by one or more replica, no single point of failure.

### MVC Architecture
* Simple and clear Module-Controller architecture.
* Use [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) to define data models.

### ES6 Promise Supported
* Promise A+ compatible
* Support ES6 generators (yield)

### Powerful Built-in Modules
* Very powerful built-in modules, like push module. You can build a full featured push/chat service with almost zero code.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### [Pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo)

Quick-pomelo is based on pomelo, have a draft idea of pomelo framework is required.

#### [MemDB](https://github.com/rain1017/memdb)

Quick-pomelo use memdb for underlaying data storage, so understanding memdb is required.

### Install dependencies

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download)
* Install [Redis](http://redis.io/download) (required for memdb)
* Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads) (required for memdb)
* Install [MemDB](https://github.com/rain1017/memdb) globally
```
sudo npm install -g memdb-server
```
* Install pomelo globally
```
sudo npm install -g rain1017/pomelo
```

### Start with template

First copy the template to your working directory. The template contains most common skeletons for a quick-pomelo game server.


### Define models

Define data models in app/models directory

```js
// app/models/player.js
module.exports = function(app){
    var mdbgoose = app.memdb.goose;

    var PlayerSchema = new mdbgoose.Schema({
        _id : {type : String},
        areaId : {type : String},
        teamId : {type : String},
        connectorId : {type : String},
        name : {type : String},
    }, {collection : 'players'});

    mdbgoose.model('Player', PlayerSchema);
};
```

### Write controllers 

Write controllers in app/controllers directory

```js
// app/controllers/player.js
var Controller = function(app){
    this.app = app;
};

var proto = Controller.prototype;

proto.createPlayerAsync = function(opts){
    // Get model by this.app.models.[model]
    var player = new this.app.models.Player(opts);
    yield player.saveAsync();
};

proto.removePlayerAsync = function(playerId){
    var player = yield this.app.models.Player.findAsync(playerId);
    if(!player){
        throw new Error('player not exist');
    }
    yield player.removeAsync();
};

module.exports = function(app){
    return new Controller(app);
};
```

### Define routes

For each type of server, write a route in app/routes directory.

```js
// app/routes/player.js
module.exports = {
    // Routing in handler
    handler : function(session, method, msg){
        // Return a string routing key
        // Same routing key always route to the same backend server.
        return session.uid || msg.playerId;
    },
    // Routing in remote
    remote : function(routeParam, method, args){
        return routeParam;
    }
};
```

### Write server handlers

Write server handlers in app/servers/[server]/handler

```js
// app/servers/player/playerHandler.js
var Handler = function(app){
    this.app = app;
};

Handler.prototype.createPlayer = function(msg, session, next){
    // Get controller by this.app.controllers.[controler]
    return this.app.controllers.player.createPlayerAsync(msg.opts)
    .nodeify(next); 
};

module.exports = function(app){
    return new Handler(app);
};
```

### Start server

Before start
* Make sure Redis and MongoDB has started.
* Create a symbol link to `[PROJECT_ROOT]/config/memdb.conf.js` in `~/.memdb/`
```
mkdir ~/.memdb
ln -s [PROJECT_ROOT]/config/memdb.conf.js ~/.memdb/memdb.conf.js
```
* Start memdb cluster
```
memdbcluster start
```

Start server
```
pomelo start --harmony (--harmony is required on node < 0.4.0)
```

### Well done! Congratulations!


## Quick's Philosophy

A typical realtime game server framework is stateful for the sake of performance, all states is kept in server local memory. However, this approach has significant drawbacks:

- Any exceptions (may be caused by bugs or unexpected client input) may result in non-consistent state (half-modified dirty data), which is very difficult to recover
- Concurrency control is very difficult to implement
- We must remember which server the data is located, and use rpc to get data, which is error prone.
- In memory data will be lost on server failure, it's very difficult to support HA

Thanks to [MemDB](http://memdb.org), quick pomelo un-invent the stateful approach and use a web server like 'MVC' based architecture. All servers become stateless and all states is stored in memdb. You can now get all benefits from a typical stateless web server, without losing performance and scalability of in memory stateful server.
